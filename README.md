# CogniCity REM Analysis
## DEPRECATED
This was a prototype. See new complete version at https://github.com/urbanriskmap/cognicity-analytics

Single page webapp for data analysis on data gathered
by cognicity. Uses the [angular seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed) project as a starter.

To start the project run:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

To build the project run
```shell
npm install
npm run build.prod
```
or use `npm run build.dev` for dev build.  

#Testing:
  ` npm test` runs the tests once

  ` npm run test.watch ` all tests will run on any file change
